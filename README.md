WinterGrad is a shitty ML library coded in C/C++ ( VERY VERY much work in progress)


<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>I've been reading a book about Machine Learning and a lot of stuff is really bugging my mind, so i am following a quote<br>
<b>"if you want to understand something, build it from scratch."<br><em>-geohot</b>
<br>
<h3>This ML Framework contains for now:</h3>
<br><em>- Linear 1D layers,
<br><em>- BCE1D Loss,
<br><em>- ReLU, LeakyReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax (every one of these is 1D respectively)
<br>
<b>For now, only basic Perceptron works (tested with iris data)</b>
